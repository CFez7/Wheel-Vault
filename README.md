# Wheel-Vault Website

Wheel-Vault is a personal project of mine and was designed to:
1) develop my skills using PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery 
2) To help car enthusiasts find wheels for their car. I found through my own experience that websites like Wheel-Vault do exist but they are extremely limited in filtering down results to find exactly what you want when only looking for second hand alloy wheels. 

** NOTE ** 

- Propel PHP Framework installed but no code converted to use this framework as of yet.
  - Please only see contents of 'includes' & 'public_html' for work.
- Image upload has limited functionality with bugs -  *Not Completed*

- System build entirely with RAW PHP, HTML, CSS with some added jQuery
